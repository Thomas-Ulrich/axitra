Two versions of axitra reflectivity code that computes the propagation of elastic waves in 3D stratified media.
The code uses the discrete wavenumber method (Bouchon 1982) in cylindrical coordinates (axi-symetric) and the reflectivy propagation
across horizontal layers
MOMENT version computes the radiation due to a moment tensor, see src/README
FORCE version computes the radiation due to unidirectional forces, see src/README
